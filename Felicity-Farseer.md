# Unlock

### Acquire one unit of Meta-Alloys
  - You can buy one in Darnielle's Progress in the Maia system
    - Go to Maia, honk every system along the way with your basic discovery scanner
    - In Maia, lock on to the Nav Beacon and drop out of supercruise next to it like you would a station.
    - Lock the beacon itself by targeting it in your contacts menu, then turn your ship to face it. You should receive system data.
    - Locate "Darnielle's Progress" in the nav list, under "Maia A 2 a". 
      - If you don't see it, head to "Maia A 2 a" and scan with your DSS
  - Now take it to Farseer Inc. in the Deciat system.
    - Again, honk every system on the way with your Basic Discovery Scanner.
  
# Rank Up


- Sell your exploration data at the universal cartographics in the Farseer Inc. station.
  - This can get you access to G5 blueprints immediately if you have enough to sell. If not, don't worry. You'll get the rest as you go.
- Complete as much of the [Increased Range Blueprint](https://inara.cz/galaxy-blueprint/2/) as you can on your runabout ship immediately.

# Gathering Mats

### Atypical Wake Echoes, Strange Wake Solutions, Eccentric Hyperspace Trajectories, Datamined Wake Exceptions

- Go to **Ray Gateway in Diaguandri** (or some other very busy station you know of), dock, then go back outside and start scanning high wakes from ships leaving the area.
- Datamined Wake Exceptions are the most rare. You will need roughly 10 of them per ship you want to fully upgrade.
- You can also trade for more of them at an Encoded Material Trader. [Use INARA to find one.](https://inara.cz/galaxy-nearest/25/17362/).
  - Ray Gateway has an Encoded Material Trader. Find it in the Contacts Menu.

### Chemical Processors, Chemical Distillery, Chemical Manipulators

- Go to **HYADES SECTOR DR-V C2-23** and scan planet **A 5** with your Detailed Surface Scanner
- Located **Dav's Hope** and land there. It does not have landing pads, just land on the ground somewhere in or around the base.
- Deploy your SRV, open your cargo scoop, and drive laps around the base picking up the resources that are just laying on the ground.
  - After each lap, log out to the main menu and back in again. This is most easily done in Solo.
- Chemical Manipulators are the most rare. Continue this loop until you have ~10 per ship you want to upgrade.

### Phosphorus, Manganese, Arsenic

- These are all resources you will get from mining, so if you have done that you probably already have lots of Phosphorus and Manganese. Arsenic is quite rare, you probably won't already have any.
- For **Arsenic** you have two choices:
  - There is a planet in the Deciat system with 2.1% Arsenic content
  - **MASSZONY 1 A A** has the highest Arsenic content in the bubble: 2.9%
- Go to one of these planets and land your ship. Deploy your SRV.
- Drive around and look for blips on your radar. Drive towards them. When you find a rock you can target, blast it and collect whatever comes out of the rock.
- You will need approx. 10 Arsenic per ship you want to upgrade. I found about 16 Arsenic in an hour.
