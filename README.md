### Ships

You will need a ship that you can "run errands" in, and you'll need one or two mining ships for the mining-exclusive materials. Finally, you might want a combat ship as well so you can collect certain resources by destroying ships instead of running missions. 

**1. Runabout**

- Fast ship with good jump range and decent internals for a varied, multipurpose loadout.
  - Asp Explorer and Diamondback Explorer come to mind
  - Here is a decent DBX starter build, for about 13 Million credits in discount space: https://s.orbis.zone/4kn8
- Detailed Surface Scanner
- Wake Scanner
- Cargo
- 1-2 SRVs
- A good fuel scoop, you'll need it

**2. Void Opal Deep Core Mining**

- Get yourself an Asp Explorer and [outfit it like this](https://s.orbis.zone/4kqe).
- Follow one of the many guides on Void Opal mining, such as [The Popular Guide to Space Mining](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-popular-guide-to-mining.216369/)

**3. Double Painite Laser Mining**

- You'll want something big with a lot of cargo. Any of the "Big 4" will work nicely.
- Here is a [sample Type-10 Defender build](https://s.orbis.zone/4kqi) with no shields or weapons but 448T of cargo.
- Follow the same guide above, which also covers laser mining. Look up a good double painite hotspot and go make some money.

You *can* use smaller ships for Painite mining too, you'll just be leaving to sell more frequently.
