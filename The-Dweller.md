### Deal with at least 5 Black Markets

This can be done in about an hour, even if you have never dealt with a single one.

**I recommend a small or medium size ship** so you can land at outposts, otherwise you will need to land on at least one planet.

1. Go to **KURUGHNAYE** and dock at **Chilton Port**
2. Buy 5 units of Imperial Slaves
3. Jump to **Scylla**

There are *nine* black markets in Scylla, but they all orbit the fourth star which is a good 10-15 minute flight out. 220,000Ls or so.

4. Fly to **Boe Dock** and dock. Use Silent Running to avoid being scanned.
5. If you *do* get scanned, pay off the fine *first*.
6. Sell one slave to the Black Market in Contacts.
7. Log out to main menu and back in. 
8. Now if you go to the Engineers menu on the right side panel, you should see 1/5 under the Dweller's requirements.

Repeat 4-8 at:
- Rzeppa City
- Ham Dock
- Carrier City
- Edison Gateway
These will all be really close together. It's just the initial flight out there that sucks. You will need to re-log after each sale to see the updated progress in your ship's menu.

After the 5th sale (and re-log) you should receive a message from The Dweller with a bookmark on his location ("**Black Hide**" in **Wyrd**).

Fly to **Wyrd** and dock at **Black Hide**. Pay 500,000 credits and re-log to unlock The Dweller.

# Gathering Materials

The two blueprints I recommend here are
- [Charge Enhanced Distributor](https://inara.cz/galaxy-blueprint/67/)
- [Efficient Beam Laser](https://inara.cz/galaxy-blueprint/170/)

With these, you'll be able to fire your beams for a ridiculous amount of time without overheating or draining the capacitor, and you'll basically double your damage output while you're at it.

### Chemical Processors, Chemical Distillery, Chemical Manipulators, Grid Resistors, Hybrid Capacitors, Heat Dispersion Plates, Heat Exchangers, Heat Vanes

- Find them all at Dav's Hope in your SRV.
- For a more detailed guide, see the same section in [Felicity Farseer's guide](https://github.com/vsTerminus/Engineering-Notes/blob/master/Felicity-Farseer.md#chemical-processors-chemical-distillery-chemical-manipulators)
- You need about 15-20 Chemical Manipulators per distributor you want to upgrade.

### Specialized Legacy Firmware, Modified Consumer Firmware, Cracked Industrial Firmware

**1. Scan Datapoints**
  
  - Fly to **HIP 12099** planet **1 B**. Scan it with your Detailed Surface Scanner.
  - You should find CMDR Jameson's crashed Cobra MkIII on the surface as a point you can navigate to. If not, it is at -54.3, -50.4
  - Land near the ship and deploy your SRV.
  - Lock onto the ship itself and scan it (the data core) with your SRV's data link scanner.
  - Now drive around back, behind the right exhaust you will see a data link you can scan. Park approx 22m away, along the ridge of rocks. Switch to turret mode, and see if you can locate and target all four data points in the area. Adjust your position until you can.
  - There is one to your right, one behind you, and one to the left over a big ridge of rocks that you probably won't be able to *see*, but will be able to target and scan.
  - Put your SRV's hand brake on (toggle on).
  - Scan all four points.
  - Log out to main menu, and back in again.
  - Repeat last two steps until you start getting messages about full cargo.
    - You are still getting uncommon materials, you're just full on the two common ones. Keep going until you're tired of it. Should be about 10 minutes or so.
    
**2. Visit a Material Trader**

  - You can now trade all of your common scans for less common ones at an Encoded Materials Trader.
  - You can [use INARA to find one](https://inara.cz/galaxy-nearest/25/47296/), or just head back to **Ray Gateway** in **Diaguandri**.
  - You can trade all those scans you just took of the crashed ship for the various firmwares you need.
    - You'll want about 15-20 Cracked Industrial Firmware per distributor you want to fully upgrade.
    
### Exquisite Focus Crystals

The hardest part of the Charge Enhanced Distributor blueprint.

You can get these from Mission Rewards, particularly in large systems with Boom economies where you are allied to all the factions. But that takes a lot of time to set up if you don't already have it.

The other way seems to be by killing Anacondas in HazRES sites and picking up the cargo they drop, which should include Exquisite Focus Crystals.

I haven't actually tried this yet. I assume you'll want collector limpets on your combat ship. Probably easiest with a wing of friends.


### Sulfur, Chromium

- Go do Void Opal Mining and you should have plenty of these. They drop in ice rings.
- You can also get them by surface prospecting in the SRV. Look at planet composition.

### Selenium, Cadmium

- Go do Painite mining and you should have plenty of these. They drop in rocky/metallic rings. 
- You can also get them by surface prospecting in the SRV. Look at planet composition.

### Proto Heat Radiators

- Trade for them at a Manufactured Materials Trader contact.
- [Find one using INARA](https://inara.cz/galaxy-nearest/25/17110/)
- Or just visit **Jensen Gateway** in **64 Ceti**
- You can gather all of the materials you need to trade from Dav's Hope. Again, see [the sections from Felicity Farseer's guide](https://github.com/vsTerminus/Engineering-Notes/blob/master/Felicity-Farseer.md#chemical-processors-chemical-distillery-chemical-manipulators)
